 The use of **public** and **private** in Spring Boot (and Java in general) comes from Java’s access modifiers — they control visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.

Even though you're using Spring Boot, these are pure Java rules, not Spring-specific.

🔐 Java Access Modifiers Recap:
Modifier	Access Level	Used For	Accessible From
public	🔓 Open	Classes, methods, fields	Anywhere (any class/package)
private	🔒 Locked	Methods, fields	Only within the same class
protected	🛡️ Partial	Methods, fields	Same package or subclasses
(default)	🧱 Package	Classes, methods, fields	Same package only
🧠 Why some things are public and others private in Spring Boot?
✅ public is used when:
The class or method is meant to be accessed by Spring or other parts of your app

Example: @RestController, service methods, @GetMapping endpoints

java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
public class MyController { // must be public so Spring can discover it

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hi!";
    }
}
Spring uses reflection under the hood, and it needs public access to work with classes/methods.

✅ private is used when:
You want to hide internal logic (encapsulation)

That method or field is only for internal use, not for other classes


@Service
public class MyService {

    public void processData() {
        String result = getInternalValue();
        // Do something
    }

    private String getInternalValue() {
        return "secret";  // Not needed outside this class
    }
}

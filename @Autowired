 What is @Autowired?
@Autowired is a Spring annotation used to automatically inject a bean (i.e., object) into another bean.

It's part of Dependency Injection — a core concept in Spring that helps manage how objects are connected.

🧠 Think of it like this:
You say:

“Hey Spring, I need this thing (a service, repo, etc.) — please wire it up for me!”

And Spring replies:

“Sure! I already have that bean created, I’ll inject it right here for you.”

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class MyService {
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyService!");
    }
}
java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;  // Spring injects this automatically

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        myService.greet();
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
💡 Behind the scenes:
Spring sees the @Autowired field

Looks for a matching MyService bean in the container

Injects it automatically (either by constructor, field, or setter)

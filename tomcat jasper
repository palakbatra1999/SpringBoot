ðŸ§  What is Tomcat Jasper?
Jasper is the JSP (JavaServer Pages) engine used inside Apache Tomcat.

So when you write .jsp files in your web app (like login.jsp), Jasper is the part of Tomcat that:

Compiles those .jsp files into Java Servlet classes

Runs them to generate dynamic HTML

In other words:

Your JSP â†’ Jasper â†’ Compiled Servlet â†’ HTML to browser




-----------------------------------------------------

ðŸ§± So what is Tomcat then?
Apache Tomcat is a lightweight web server + servlet container that runs your Java web app.

Spring Boot embeds Tomcat by default â€” so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.

âœ… Why would I see "tomcat-jasper" in my dependencies?
If you're using JSP in your Spring Boot app (not common in modern setups), you'll need:


<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
  <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
</dependency>
Because:

Spring Boot does NOT include Jasper by default

If you use .jsp, you need to add this manually
